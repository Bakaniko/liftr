# liftr 0.4.9000 (2017-04-06)

## New Features

- Added RStudio addins as shortcuts to create, containerize, and render R Markdown documents.
- Added new argument `cache` in `render_docker()` to improve rendering speed significantly by caching Docker image layers [[#18](https://github.com/road2stat/liftr/issues/18)].
- Added new argument `purge_info` to `render_docker()`. This argument controls whether to output the Docker image and container name into an YAML file for purging purposes later.
- Separate the creation and removal of Docker containers and images: removed the old argument `reset` in `render_docker()`; added `purge_container()` and `purge_image()` for cleaning up.

## Improvements

- Renamed `drender()` to `render_docker()`. `drender()` is now deprecated.
- New website (https://liftr.me) generated by pkgdown, with a full set of function documentation and vignettes available.
- Added Appveyor support for continuous integration under Windows.
- Removed Rabix support temporarily to embrace its new version in the future.

## Bug Fixes

- Removed `-t` and `-i` from `docker run` to fix [#17](https://github.com/road2stat/liftr/issues/17).

## New Features

- Added new R Markdown header option `pandoc` to control Pandoc installation. Automatically set this to `false` for `rocker/rstudio` and `bioconductor/...` images. This solves [#12](https://github.com/road2stat/liftr/issues/12).

# liftr 0.1 (2015-07-10)

## New Features
