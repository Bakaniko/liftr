# misc

- merge the following todo list into `news.md` when they are done

# infrastructure

- output image name and container name into a `.yml` file with the same name as the RMD for `drender()` runs.
- make purge functions clean things up based on this `yml` file.
- add a metadata field for including extra custom Dockerfile snippet(s) into the Dockerfile, and support this in `lift()`, add this into vignette.
- Honor remote packages grammar: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/vignettes/dependencies.html instead of GitHub packages only in metadata.

# ui

- add RStudio addins to create, dockerize, and render RMD files.
