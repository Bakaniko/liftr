# misc

- merge the following todo list into `news.md` when they are done

# infrastructure

- add a metadata field for including extra custom Dockerfile snippet(s) into the Dockerfile, and support this in `lift()`, add this into vignette. This potentially solves https://github.com/road2stat/liftr/issues/21.
- Honor remote packages grammar: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/vignettes/dependencies.html instead of GitHub packages only in metadata.
- add BioC RNA-Seq workflow example.

# ui

- add RStudio addins to create, containerize, and render RMD files.

# doc

- record new video demo
